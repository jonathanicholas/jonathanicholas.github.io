Iâ€™m a cognitive neuroscientist interested in decision making and memory. My research uses behavioral, computational, and neural methods to investigate how we use the past to behave more effectively in the future.

I am currently a postdoctoral scientist working with [Marcelo Mattar](http://mattarlab.com/) at New York University. I received my PhD in Psychology from Columbia University, working with [Daphna Shohamy](https://shohamylab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/). Prior to graduate school, I developed research software in [Vinod Menon's](https://med.stanford.edu/scsnl.html) lab at Stanford University, and was an undergrad at Brown University.
